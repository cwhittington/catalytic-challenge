# Notes

## Unrecognized Requests

I noticed that the test cases are all positive, so I decided to add some negative test cases.  This involved adding a new template for unrecognized requests, which is returned under either of the following:

* There is no provided message body
* There is a provided message body, but it is not recognized or otherwise invalid.
